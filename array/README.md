### Find pair with given sum in the array
Given an unsorted array of integers, find a pair with given sum in it.

### Maximum subarray problem (Kadane’s algorithm)
Given an array of integers, find contiguous subarray within it which has the largest sum.

### Longest Increasing Subsequence
The longest increasing subsequence problem is to find a subsequence of a given sequence in which the subsequence’s elements are in sorted order, lowest to highest, and in which the subsequence is as long as possible. This subsequence is not necessarily contiguous, or unique.
